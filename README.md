# Item-Catalog-Project
Per the Udacity Nanodegree course, this project utilizes sqlite, frameworks such as flask, and other modules to create a web server in Python that is able to handle CRUD operations and securely store information. Authentication and Authorization is also implemented.



Steps to run:
(If using a linux OS, skip vagrant steps.)
- Install Vagrant and VirtualBox
- Launch the Vagrant VM (vagrant up)
- SSH into the VM (vagrant ssh)
- go to directory where you placed files
- run python project.py, it should tell you the server is running on localhost:5000
- on a browser, go to http://localhost:5000
- enjoy!
